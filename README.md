##Description
The POculus library intends to render processing sketches for Oculus. It uses the JOGL support for Oculus to acheieve this functionaility.

POculus provices an Oculus renderer which needs to be specified in size(). Anything you now draw will be rendered in Oculus view.

Note: Oculus needs to be plugged in before running the sketch. Also since, POculus uses updated JOGL libraries, it currently works through eclipse only. You can download all the required jars from [here]().
